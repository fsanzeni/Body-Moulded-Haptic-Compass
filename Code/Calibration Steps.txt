LSM9DS1 Calibration Steps

1. Type in COM port 'A' to start Accelerometer calibration.
	1.1 Type in COM port 'C' to start calibration
	1.2 Start from board lying down, USB port facing away from you
	1.3 Flip board to the right on its right side and rerun
	1.4 Flip board to the right on its back and rerun
	1.5 Flip board to the right on its left side and rerun
	1.6 Flip board on its bottom (where the UBLOX module is) and rerun
	1.7 Flip board on its head (where the USB port is) and rerun
	1.8 Accelerometer calibration complete. Don't move the board. Type 'X' in COM port to go back

2. Type in COM port 'G' to start Gyroscope calibration.
	2.1 Offset will be calculated. Don't move the board
	2.2 Flip board lying flat, with the USB port pointing towards you
	2.3 Type 'A', press enter. Type '180' and press enter. Type 'C' to start slope calibration.
	2.4 Calmly rotate board 180 degrees. When finished turning, press ENTER to stop measuring.
	2.5 Flip board on its bottom (where the UBLOX module is) and rerun.
	2.6 Flip board on its side (either) and rerun.
	2.7 Gyroscope calibration complete. Don't move the board. Type 'X' in COM port to go back

3. Type in COM port 'M' to start Magnetometer calibration.
	3.1 Type 'C' to start calibrating.
	3.2 Jiggle board along magnetic field inclination, on each side of the board. Press ENTER when finished.
	3.3 Magnetometer calibration complete. Type 'X' in COM port to go back

4. Copy the values displayed on the COM port for your calibration.
